    <h1>My Favorite Bass Players</h1>

    <h2>John Myung</h2>

    <p>A great player from the band "Dream Theater". Myung has simply mastered his craft and he can play anything that is put in front of him. He plays a Music Man Bongo bass and it's as iconic as him. So what makes him so great? Well he wasn't born with it. He would spend most hours of his day practising and he went to Berkley. For some of his best work, check out the songs:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Ytse Jam</li>
    <li>Metropolis - Part 1</li>
    <li>The Dance of Eternity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tim Commerford</h2>

    <p>From the band "Rage Against The Machine", Commerford isn't a name that comes up much in the discussion of great bass players. He might not be the most techincal player but his style fits the music perfectly and his tone is unmatched. Something we rarely hear in todays music is the bass taking so much space as Tim does and it's a shame. Every track Commerford plays on is blessed with a funky bass line that makes you do the "stank face". He, just like Myung, plays a Music Man bass (coincidence? I think not) If you haven't heard it, oh boy you're in for a treat. Here are some of my top songs he plays on:</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>Take the Power Back</li>
        <li>Bullet In the Head</li>
        <li>Know Your Enemy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tetsuo Sakurai</h2>
    <img src="Images/Tetsuo_Sakurai.jpg" alt="A picture of bass player Tetsuo Sakurai">
    <p>The first bass player in the Japanese Jazz fusion band "Casiopea". Sakurai, much like Commerford, isn't the most techincal player ou there but he is a master of the "Slap" technice. His slapping always acompanice the music so nicely that every track he played on for Casiopea is considered some of their best work. The music, as well as the slaping, is the perfect music to put on when you just want music. Having one of those days where you can't figure out what artist to listen to? Casiopea is the defult go to for me. They make the best "backround music" out there and that's a compliment. I have listend to their "Mint Jams" live record over and over and over again, and Sakurais bass briliance is certanly a big reason for that. Here is some of his most iconic songs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>セイリング - ァロ一ン (Saling Alone)</li>
        <li>マジック - レイ (Magic Ray)</li>
        <li>ドミノ - フイン (Domino Line)</li>
    </ul>
